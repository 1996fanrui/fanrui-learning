     * Most of the time, you need to maintain some state while the benchmark is
     * running. Since JMH is heavily used to build concurrent benchmarks, we
     * opted for an explicit notion of state-bearing objects.
     *
     * Below are two state objects. Their class names are not essential, it
     * matters they are marked with @State. These objects will be instantiated
     * on demand, and reused during the entire benchmark trial.
     *
     * The important property is that state is always instantiated by one of
     * those benchmark threads which will then have the access to that state.
     * That means you can initialize the fields as if you do that in worker
     * threads (ThreadLocals are yours, etc).

     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * You are expected to see the drastic difference in shared and unshared cases,
     * because you either contend for single memory location, or not. This effect
     * is more articulated on large machines.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_03 -wi 5 -i 5 -t 4 -f 1
     *    (we requested 5 measurement/warmup iterations, with 4 threads, single fork)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
